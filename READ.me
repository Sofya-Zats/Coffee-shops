🧭 Introduction
This project analyzes and visualizes crime data from Los Angeles, showcasing how incidents evolved across different time periods, especially surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses visual storytelling to provide insights into trends, frequency, and spatial distribution of crimes using heatmaps and time-based plots.

✨ Features
📊 Comparative visualizations (Before, During, and After COVID-19)
🗺️ Geographic heatmaps using Folium
📈 Trend lines, histograms, bar plots, and more
🔍 Insights on crime type distribution and time-based trends
🧼 Cleaned and processed large datasets with Pandas and NumPy
📍 Location-based clustering and hotspot detection
⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/la-crime-analysis.git
cd la-crime-analysis
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

🔽 To explore the project:

Download the repository and open it locally, OR
Use VS Code in the browser by visiting:
👉 https://vscode.dev/github/manishsarmaa/LA_crime
Make sure the dataset (e.g., LA_crime_data.csv) is placed in the project directory or update the path in the script accordingly.
Run the analysis script:
python crime_analysis.py
Outputs such as charts and maps will be saved in the outputs/ directory or displayed inline if run in a Jupyter Notebook.
🌐 Visualization Highlights

🧯 Troubleshooting
Heatmap not displaying? Ensure Folium is correctly installed and you are opening the HTML output in a browser.
Encoding issues with the dataset? Try opening the CSV using encoding='latin1' or 'utf-8'.
Map markers not accurate? Check if lat/lon columns are clean and not null.
